FIXME: Configuration/Building
	Is there a better way to configure than with customMake? Can we use autoconf or are there simply too many options?

Code Generator for other actions: STAGGERED For MILC, Twisted Mass 

Better testing: 
	Currently tested through a muBench, and most rigorously through the QPhiX library
	Test SSE, AVX2, AVX512
