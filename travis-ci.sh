# The submodules are downloaded via SSH. This means that there has to be some
# SSH key registered with GitHub. The Travis CI virtual machine does not have
# any key. Therefore this will download a SSH key which is registered as a
# read-only deploy key with that repository. The virtual machine will then use
# this key to authenticate against GitHub. Only then it can download the public
# readable submodules. Another approach would be to switch to HTTPS for the
# submodules.
