To do with QDPJIT:
  - Thorough testing for SOA combinations (initially done with 4)
  - Bullet proofing assertions that data is in OCSRI layout or make the code generically figure out the right layout.
  - Write native dslash using raw pointers: need OSCRI layout assertion and InnerLength assertion (easy)
    - but issue w.r.t currently onle inner=8 from QDPJIT apparently working in my tests

TO Do:
- Add cache blocking in X -- hooks are already present in the kernels, but need to adapt loops.
- Solve N-systems at once (ongoing PhD project at Old Dominion University Computer Science Department: ODU-JLab collaboration)
- Clean code for non ICC compilers (work ongoing by Diptorup Deb, Renaissance Computing Institute, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill
- Bullet proof a little (A LOT!!!)
- Better tuning (implement 1/2/3/4 threads per core instead of just all 4)
- reduce verbosite and use master printf to better effect (log levels?)
- more fine grained testing and automatic testing
- ... Your desiderata here...
